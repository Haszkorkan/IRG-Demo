      <p>Independent Regulators Group</p>

  <div class="article--content">
      <p>The Independent Regulators Group (IRG) was established in 1997 as a group of European National
        Telecommunications Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) to share experiences and points of views among its
        members on important issues relating to the regulation and development of the European
        telecommunications market at the beginning of the liberalisation of the markets (with the 1998 so-called
        Open Network Provision (ONP) framework).</p>
      <p>IRG was registered as a not-for-profit organisation under Belgian law (ASBL) and has a Brussels-based
        Secretariat The statutes (English version) were published in the annex of the Belgian State Gazette on 27
        May 2008</p>
      <p>The European Regulators Group (ERG) for electronic communications networks and services was set up
        with a Decision of the European Commission in 2002 as an advisory group to the Commission when the
        new" regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services was enacted in 2002. The
        ERG's mission was to provide a suitable mechanism for encouraging cooperation and coordination between
        national regulatory authorities and the Commission so to promote the development of the internal market for
        electronic communications networks and services and to seek consistent application of the provisions set
        out in the Directives of the new regulatory framework in all member states</p>
      <p>The group is the EU's primary forum for exchange of best practices, benchmarking, knowledge management,
        education and in-depth and forward-looking discussions on current and future regulatory challenges in
        communications.</p>
      <p>As a successor to ERG, the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) and the
        Office were established by the Regulation (EC) No. 1211/2009 ofthe European Parliament and of the Council
        of 25 November 2009 with an enhanced role in the new regulatory framework. BEREC is comprised of a
        Board of Regulators consisting of Heads of 28 national regulatory authorities (NRAs). The EU Commission,
        EFTA States (Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and three EU candidate countries (Turkey, the
        Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania) participate as observers to the Board of Regulators.
      </p>
      <h3>Our mission:</h3>
      <p>IRG serves as a facilitator to its members, bringing tailor-made and flexible support to the fulfillment of the
        their roles.<br />IRG works at improving collaboration, mutual assistance and information exchange between NRAs while
        ensuring equal opportunities for all its 37 members.
